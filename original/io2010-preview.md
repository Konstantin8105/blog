[Google I/O 2010](https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/google-io-2010-now-open-for.html)
is happening next week at the Moscone Centre in San Francisco.
Those of you with tickets will be able to catch some of the Go team both
at I/O and at Bootcamp.
In reverse-chronological order:

Rob Pike and Russ Cox will be presenting a [Go Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgVhBThJdXc)
talk on Thursday at 10.15am.
This session takes a detailed look at how Go differs from other languages
in a practical sense.
Through a series of examples, they will demonstrate various features of
Go and the ways in which they affect program design.

Several members of the Go team will be at the Go cube during Office Hours
on Wednesday between 12pm and 2:30pm.
Come by to have your Go questions answered by the experts.

At Bootcamp on Tuesday at 4.15pm, Andrew Gerrand will be giving an introductory talk about Go.
The session will give an overview of the problems that motivated us to build a new language,
and the ways in which Go addresses those problems.

If you're coming to I/O, we look forward to seeing you there!
